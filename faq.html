		<h2>General</h2>

		<h3>Do the developers earn money with the app?</h3>
		<p>No, the app is distributed for free, there are no ads and we don't get paid for it.</p>

		<h3>Will it be ad-free forever?</h3>
		<p>We're not planning any ads at this time. We can't say never: If the developers are suddenly charged significant fees for distribution of this app, we may need to implement ads to pay those.</p>

		<h3>I found a bug!</h3>
		<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/padyx/purplemoon-android/issues">list of known issues</a> if it was already reported, then report a new one.</p>

		<h2>Install / uninstall</h2>
		<h3>The app does not work on my device!</h3>
		<p>We're trying to support as many devices and versions of Android as possible. Please file a bug describing exactly which device you own and which version of Android it runs.</p>

		<h3>Does the app run on unofficial versions ("Custom-ROM") of Android?</h3>
		<p>Probably, if you have the Google Play services installed. But we can't offer any guarantees.</p>

		<h3>What are the minimum requirements for installation?</h3>
		<p>The mimimum requirements are always enforced by the Play Store. Besides a compatible Android version, the Google Play Services are required for push notifications.</p>

		<h2>Your data</h2>
		<h3>How is my data used?</h3>
		<p>The app exchanges data with the servers of the Purplemoon website when you use the app. For example: Sent messages and visited profiles.</p>
		<p>This includes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Explicitely provided data (uploaded pictures, messages)</li>
		<li>Your interactions (creating post-its, visiting profiles)</li>
		<li>Location data, if you enable the feature (Showing users near your location)</li>
		<li>Data required for internet communication (your IP address)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This app does not send your data to other websites apart from the Purplemoon website.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.purplemoon.ch/about/privacy.html">privacy policy of the Purplemoon webseite</a> informs you how they use your data.</p>

		<h2>Power User</h2>
		<h3>What is the power user program?</h3>
		<p>The Purplemoon website offers some additional features to paying users to pay its bills. To see details, check out the 
		<a href="https://www.purplemoon.ch/support">"support us" page</a> of Purplemoon.</p>

		<h3>Do you earn anything from the power user program?</h3>
		<p>No, the developers of the app are not paid and don't get a share of any Purplemoon revenue. Given some fees, this app is developed at a loss.</p>

		<h3>Why is feature X only available for power users?</h3>
		<p>This is determined by the application interface of Purplemoon and determined by the company running the Purplemoon website.</p>

		<h3>How can I become a power user?</h3>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.purplemoon.ch/support">"support us" page</a> of Purplemoon.</p>
